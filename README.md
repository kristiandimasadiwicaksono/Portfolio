# 🌐 Personal Portfolio - Kristian Dimas A.W

This is my personal developer portfolio built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
The original template was adapted from [BraydenTW's portfolio](https://github.com/BraydenTW/react-tailwind-portfolio), and customized to suit my own projects and experiences.

## 🚀 Features

- Responsive modern UI using React + Tailwind CSS
- Dynamic data sourced from a single `data.js` file
- Dark mode ready (if supported by the template)
- Reusable components
- Sections: About, Skills, Projects, Certificates, and Contact
